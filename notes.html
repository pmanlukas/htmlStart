<h5>How the Internet works</h5>
<p>The Web is a Application on the Internet</p>

<h5>HTML Basics</h5>
<p>Hyper Text Markup Language, is a Markup language, to design the structure
    of a Webpage. There is always an opening and 
    an closing tag. Tags are elements you can use to structure your webpage.
    If I want <b>bold</b> text, then I use the b tag. If you miss the closing tag,
    than our browser won't crash, but everything after the tag will be affected by
    the tag.
</p>
<p>
    HTML also offers attributes for tags, that are added in the opening tag. So when
    using a, the anchor tag, for creating links, than the href attribute sets the 
    location of the link.
</p>
<p>
    If I want to add an image to a webpage you use the img tag. You have to define a
    source, this is the location where the image is saved. The alt attribute defines
    text, that loads if the image is not there.
</p>
<p>If you forget something, than you find all required infos in the documentation of 
    the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">W3</a>.
